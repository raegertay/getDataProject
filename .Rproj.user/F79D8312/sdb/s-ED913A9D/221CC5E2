This guide aims to explain how the analysis script works.\n\nThe dataset consists of the following files:\n\n* X_test - contains test measuremnts  \n* X_train - contains training measurements  \n* y_test - contains test activity id  \n* y_train - cotains training activity id  \n* subject_test - contains test subjects  \n* subject_train - contains training subjects  \n* features - contains features pertaining to the measurements  \n* activity_labels - contains reference table for the activity  \n\n### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.\na. Merge X_test and X_train (measurements) + Add \"features\" as variables names\n```{r, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n```{r}\nX_test <- read.table(file = \"./dataset/test/X_test.txt\")\nX_train <- read.table(file = \"./dataset/train/X_train.txt\")\nX_all <- rbind(X_test, X_train)\nfeatures <- read.table(file = \"./dataset/features.txt\")\nnames(X_all) <- make.names(names = features[ ,2], unique = TRUE)\ndim(X_all)\n```\n*Note: make.names() was used as the default feature names contains invalid column name syntax like \"(\", \")\" etc.*\n\nb. Merge y_test and y_train (activity labels)\n```{r}\ny_test <- read.table(file = \"./dataset/test/y_test.txt\", col.names = \"activity\")\ny_train <- read.table(file = \"./dataset/train/y_train.txt\", col.names = \"activity\")\ny_all <- rbind(y_test, y_train)\ndim(y_all)\n```\n\nc. Merge subject_test and subject_train (subject)\n```{r}\nsubject_test <- read.table(file = \"./dataset/test/subject_test.txt\", col.names = \"subject\")\nsubject_train <- read.table(file = \"./dataset/train/subject_train.txt\", col.names = \"subject\")\nsubject_all <- rbind(subject_test, subject_train)\ndim(subject_all)\n```\n\nd. Merge subject, activity labels and measurements\n```{r}\ndata_all <- cbind(y_all, subject_all, X_all)\ndata_all <- tbl_df(data_all)\ndim(data_all)\n```\n\n### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. \nangle() measurements were not extracted as they are not mean of any measurements, but are calculated from other measurements' mean.\n```{r}\ndata_sub <- select(data_all, activity, subject, matches(\"mean|std\", ignore.case = FALSE))\ndim(data_sub)\nnames(data_sub)\n```\n\n### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set\n```{r}\nactivity_labels <- read.table(file = \"./dataset/activity_labels.txt\")\ndata_named <- mutate(data_sub, activity = activity_labels[activity, 2])\ndata_named[1:5, 1:5]\n```\n\n### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. \n**Completed in Step 1**\n\n### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\n```{r}\ndata_grouped <- group_by(data_named, activity, subject)\ndata_tidy <- summarise_each(data_grouped, funs(mean))\ndim(data_tidy)\ndata_tidy[1:5,1:5]\nwrite.table(data_tidy, file = \"data_tidy.txt\", row.names = FALSE)\n```\nNote that output tidy data is in **wide form**.\n\n### 6. Reading data_tidy\n```{r}\ndata_tidy.read <- read.table(file = \"data_tidy.txt\", header = TRUE) \ndim(data_tidy.read)\ndata_tidy.read[1:5,1:5]\n```",
